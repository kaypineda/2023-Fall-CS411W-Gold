        <h1>Problem Description</h1>

        <h2>Societal Problem</h2>
        <p>
            People have many tasks and comparatively little time. <b>People have difficulty organizing and
            prioritizing tasks.</b> A person may create a schedule only to realize the schedule does not
            work for that person, resulting in that person starting over.
        </p>

        <br>
